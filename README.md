Bookstore - Building a Modern Bridge Between Ember and Rails 5 with JSON API
Bookstore Rails Backend 
http://emberigniter.com/modern-bridge-ember-and-rails-5-with-json-api/

This is the backend implementation of a bookstore app using Rails 5 API.
Models have been defined with relationships, subclassing, and polymorphism to align with UI better.

This project is backend only and is complemented with an ember front end found at:
https://github.com/ckl1989/bookstore-ember


This project is intended to exemplify the design of a rails backend supporting a ember front end through JSON API.

Backend: Ember 5.0.0beta3
